# WinBoat Bridge

WinBoat Bridge is an orchestration tool that allows a Linux system to run commands inside a virtualized Windows environment (WinBoat) transparently.
Unlike standard solutions like SSH or WinRM (used only for bootstrap), WinBoat Bridge provides a direct and fast channel, ideal for Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines and test automation.

## 1. Configuration (.env File)

The project uses a .env file to manage paths and credentials.
Copy the example file and customize it before you start:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - .env File Syntax:**
- Use **double backslashes** (`\\`) for Windows paths
- **DO NOT use quotes** for values

Correct example:
```bash
WINBOAT_EXE_PATH=C:\\Users\\gianca\\Desktop\\Shared\\progetti\\rust\\winboat-bridge\\target\\release\\winboat-bridge.exe
WINBOAT_LOG_PATH=C:\\Users\\gianca\\server.log
```

Main parameters:
- **WINBOAT_EXE_PATH**: Absolute path (on Windows side) where the server is located
- **WINBOAT_HOST / PORT**: Address and port for bootstrap (WinRM)
- **WINBOAT_CLIENT_PORT**: Port on the Linux system (Host) mapped to the container
- **WINBOAT_SERVER_PORT**: Internal port of the Windows container that the server listens on

The .env file is automatically searched in:
1. Current working directory
2. Executable directory
3. Project root (if executable in `target/release`)

## 2. Compilation

The project generates a single binary. It must be compiled for Windows (Server) and Linux (Client).

### A. Build for Windows (Server)

You have two options, depending on where you are:

#### Option 1: Cross-compilation from Linux (Recommended for CI/CD)

If you're working on NixOS or Linux, use the dedicated script:

```bash
./build_windows.sh
```

#### Option 2: Native compilation on Windows

If you have direct access to a Windows system with Rust installed:
1. Open a PowerShell in the project root.
2. Run: `cargo build --release`
3. You'll find the file in `target\release\winboat-bridge.exe`.

Make sure the file is in the shared folder and that the path in .env (WINBOAT_EXE_PATH) points correctly to this binary.

### B. Build for Linux (Client)

On your Linux machine, compile normally:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## 3. Global Installation (Linux)

To run winboat-bridge from any folder, create a symbolic link in the user binaries directory. Following the XDG standard, the correct directory is ~/.local/bin.

```bash
# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

# Create a symbolic link to the newly compiled binary
ln -sf "$(pwd)/target/release/winboat-bridge" ~/.local/bin/winboat-bridge
```

Note: Make sure ~/.local/bin is in your $PATH (check ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc).

## 4. Docker Compose Integration

Configure port mapping in your docker-compose.yml to expose the necessary services:

```yaml
services:
  windows:
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:47320:5985"  # WinRM (For automatic bootstrap)
      - "127.0.0.1:47330:5330"  # WinBoat Bridge (Client-Server communication)
```

## 5. Usage Examples

Once the .env file is configured, the Linux client will handle everything automatically (including starting the Windows server if it's off).

Verify connection:

```bash
winboat-bridge -c "ipconfig"
```

Run PowerShell script:

```bash
winboat-bridge -c "powershell -File C:\Scripts\Setup-Test.ps1"
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem              | Possible Cause          | Solution |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| The command "hangs" | Zombie connection       | Ctrl+C and restart; the client will force a new bootstrap. |
| Connection Refused    | Wrong port mapping     | Check with `docker ps` that port 47330 is open. |
| "WINBOAT_EXE_PATH must be set" | .env file not found or wrong syntax | Verify that the .env file exists and uses double backslashes (`\\`) without quotes. Run with `--help` to see the message `[DEBUG] Loaded .env from: ...` |
| .env parsing error   | Wrong syntax          | Use double backslashes (`\\`) for Windows paths and DO NOT use quotes. |

### .env Loading Debug

To verify that the .env file is loaded correctly, run:

```bash
./target/release/winboat-bridge --help 2>&1 | grep DEBUG
```

You should see:
```
[DEBUG] Loaded .env from: /path/to/.env
```

If you see `[WARNING] No .env file found`, check that:
1. The .env file exists in the current directory, executable directory, or project root
2. The syntax is correct (double backslashes, no quotes)
3. The file has correct read permissions
